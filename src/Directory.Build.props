  Note: You may see MSBuild warnings MSB4211:
  - "Platform is being set ... but was already consumed" (Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props)
  - "GetTargetPathDependsOn is being set ... but was already consumed" (Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets)
  These are harmless and do not affect the build. Do not set these properties here;
  setting them in Directory.Build.props can make the warnings worse.
