Sample #10 for yaneSDK2nd

A sample of CCellAutomaton.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A cellular automaton is where each pixel has certain rules and
transitions to the next state based on those rules.

For example, when blurring while scrolling upward:

    *Å†*
    Å°*Å°

The pixel value (RGB) of Å† in the next moment is determined by
the weighted average of the pixel values (RGB) of the two Å° pixels below it,
to the left and right.

There seem to be various possible applications.
If you create any interesting screen effects, please let Yaneurao know by email ^^
