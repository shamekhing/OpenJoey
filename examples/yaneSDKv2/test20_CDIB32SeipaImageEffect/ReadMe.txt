Sample #20 for yaneSDK2nd

I implemented a CDIB32 functor that converts images to sepia tone.

The image is from "Aoki Daichi" which will be released by WAFFLE this spring.
The graphics are very lovely, so please do consider buying it ^^;

While redistribution of this archive itself is permitted, please
refrain from secondary use of the images.

Regarding the source code, you are free to quote and use it.
To compile the source code, yaneSDK2nd version 1.00É¿11 or later is required.
