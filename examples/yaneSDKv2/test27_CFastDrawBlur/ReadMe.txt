Sample #27 for yaneSDK2nd

A blur sample using CFastDraw and CFastPlane.
Created by Enra-san.

The blur is applied using BlendBlt.

    New Secondary =
    Previous Secondary Å~ 50% + Surface to be drawn Å~ 50%

In other words, by drawing to a surface created with CreateSurface,
and then using BlendBlt from there to the secondary surface, a blur effect is applied.

The image is a background from "SisterAngel", which is planned
to be released from our own brand next spring.
Please refrain from secondary use of this image.
