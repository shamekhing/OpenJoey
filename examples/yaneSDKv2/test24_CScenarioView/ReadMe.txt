Sample #24 for yaneSDK2nd

    CScenarioView program sample.

    You can write scenarios using HTML-like language.
    Background specifications and effects can be written within the scenario text.
    For details, please refer to the CScenarioView class in the manual.

    "Aoki Daichi"/WAFFLE is based on this class.
    (Though it's not used exactly as is)

    Game materials are not included in this archive.


    Åô For those who really want to see this program in action Åô

    Create a folder named "scn" in the installation directory of "Aoki Daichi" 
    (where DAICHI.exe is located), move scn.dat there, extract it using 
    yanePackEx, then move test24.exe (included in this archive) to the folder 
    containing DAICHI.exe. Run it there and select the scenario file 
    (in the scn folder) that was just extracted.

    This will allow you to view it.

    However, neither I (Yaneurao) nor the publisher (WAFFLE) guarantee 
    this operation.


Regarding the source code, you are free to quote and use it.
