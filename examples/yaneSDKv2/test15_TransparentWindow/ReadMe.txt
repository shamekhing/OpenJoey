Sample #15 for yaneSDK2nd

A sample of variable window. Press ESC key to exit.
(Give it focus and hold the ESC key slightly longer)

Also, dragging is restricted to specific areas only (lol)

The image data is from WAFFLE's "Aoki Daichi" character, colored by Yaneurao ^^;
It's only about 80% colored, so please excuse the really messy finish (lol)
By the way, I took the liberty to modify the clothes and hairstyle to my liking ^^;

"Aoki Daichi" is scheduled for release around March next year, so please consider purchasing it ^^;

While redistribution of this archive itself is permitted, please refrain from secondary use of the images
as I'm embarrassed about them (lol). I need to finish this artwork soon ^^;

Regarding the source code, you are free to quote and use it.
To compile the source code, yaneSDK2nd version 1.00É¿5 or later is required.
